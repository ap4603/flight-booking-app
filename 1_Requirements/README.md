## ANALYSES
   Finding a flight was a much more tiresome and complicated task not so long ago than it is today. Making a phone call or physically going to a point of sale were the only two possibilities. Travel agencies and airline counters were the only way to consult flights for those who needed to book a destination. The airlines were precisely the ones that fostered the introduction of information technologies in ticket sales management. The pioneer was American Airlines. At the beginning of the 1970s, it developed an operating system called SABRE in conjunction with IBM, one of the best known and oldest information technology companies. Its aim was to make the management of bookings easier. The benefits it offered were two-fold. One the one hand, efficiency was boosted and, on the other, more users could be reached. All this, however, did not include the productâ€™s marketing to third parties. As a matter of fact, it was soon sold to be implemented at other airlines and travel agencies. Its scope was not only focused on flights, but also included hotel bookings and vehicle rentals.
